# ComputationalPhysics

This project was created to store semester exercises of course Computational Physics (Department of Physics, University of Athens).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need:
1. [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root) package
2. Some [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) distribution
